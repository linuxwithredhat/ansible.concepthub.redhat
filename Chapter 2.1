===========================================
Default Ansible Configuration file Location
===========================================
  # cat /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
    
=======================================
Default Ansible Inventory file Location
=======================================
  # cat /etc/ansible/hosts
  
  
  NOTE: if you want, you can change your location from the default.

 
 example:  
  # copy /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg ~/ansible/ansible.cfg
  # copy /etc/ansible/hosts ~/ansible/hosts
  
  Note:
  # cat /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
  already here you noticed that the ansible.cfg file is incomplte. there is no more information inside the file. please carefully read the 
  following instructions. type:
  # ansible-config init --disabled > ansible.cfg
  or
  # ansible-config init --disabled -t all > ansible.cfg
  
=============================
configuration file precedence
=============================
Step1:
  Changes can be made and used in a configuration file which will be searched for in the following order:
   • ANSIBLE_CONFIG (environment variable if set)
   • ansible.cfg (in the current directory)
   • ~/.ansible.cfg (in the home directory)
   • /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

To check configuration file precedence 
Method1:
  Ansible will process the above list and use the first file found, all others are ignored.
  ansible --version command to clearly identify which version of Ansible is installed, and which configuration file is being used.
    # ansible --version
    ansible [core 2.12.2]
    config file = /root/ansible.cfg 
    ..........output omitted...........
 
 Method2:
   Another way to display the active Ansible configuration file is to use the -v option when executing Ansible commands on the command line.
   #ansible servers --list-hosts -v
     Using /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg as config file
     ...output omitted...
